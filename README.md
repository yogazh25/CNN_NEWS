## Problem Descriptions
This is a project to implemented a data pipeline which monitors, scrapes and dedupes latest news. 
I Built a single-page web application for users to browse news and implemented a click event log processor which collects users’ click logs, then
updates a news preference model for each user (NLP). In this project, I designed an offline training pipeline for news topic modeling and deployed an online classifying service for news topic modeling using the trained
